# Azure Cosmos DB Chat Sample Reference Application

This is a sample application that combines Azure Cosmos DB with ASP.NET Blazor Server, to provide a simple chat application. 

This application can be run locally without an Azure subscription using an [Azure Cosmos DB Free Trial Account](https://aka.ms/Trycosmosdbc). This can also be deployed to Azure App Service with an Azure subscription.

This application was built using:
- Azure Cosmos DB
- ASP.NET Blazor Server

## Features

This application has support for multiple chat sessions. These are displayed in the left-hand nav of the application. Clicking on a session will show the messages for that chat session. Users can rename or delete chat sessions. To type into a chat, provide a user name in the upper right corner.

The history for all sessions and chats are stored in Azure Cosmos DB. Deleting a chat session in the app will delete all messages for that chat. When the user clicks on a chat session, the application will initially return the first 100 messages in that chat. As the user scrolls back, the application will fetch additional chat messages, 100 at a time. 

Please note this is a sample application. It is intended to demonstrate a use case for Azure Cosmos DB and Azure App Services. It is not intended to be used as-is for production or other large scale use.
